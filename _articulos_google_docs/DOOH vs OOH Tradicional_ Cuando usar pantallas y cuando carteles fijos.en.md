In the world of **Outdoor Advertising (OOH)**, technology has opened a new front line: **Digital Out of Home (DOOH)**. It is no longer just about choosing the best corner in the city, but about choosing the format that best communicates your message.

Many clients come to **Kapi** with the idea that "digital is always better". And while we love technology, the honest answer is: **it depends**.

Today we break down the key differences so you can invest your media budget intelligently.

## Traditional OOH: The King of Permanence

Traditional OOH (billboards, wallscapes, six-sheets) has an advantage that no screen can match: **exclusive permanence**.

*   **100% Share of Voice:** When you rent a billboard, that space is yours 24 hours a day. You don't share rotation with 5 other brands.
*   **Geographic Impact:** Ideal for signaling physical locations ("200m ahead", "At the next exit").
*   **Long-Term Brand Building:** By being fixed for months, it becomes part of the mental landscape of those who travel that route daily.

**When to choose it?**
*   Brand launches that need high recall.
*   Directing to physical branches.
*   Simple messages that do not change over time.

## DOOH: The Revolution of Flexibility

LED screens and digital mupis offer something paper cannot: **dynamism and segmentation**.

*   **Unlimited Creativity:** You can rotate multiple creatives, do countdowns, or change the message depending on the time of day (e.g., promote coffee in the morning and beer at night).
*   **Flexible Entry Cost:** You don't need to buy the whole month. You can advertise by time slots or specific days, which sometimes reduces the barrier to entry.
*   **Contextuality:** Some circuits allow programmatic buying, showing your ad only when certain conditions are met (weather, traffic, etc.).

**When to choose it?**
*   Tactical campaigns or limited-time offers.
*   Brands that have multiple products to show.
*   When you seek to make an impact at specific moments (e.g., leaving work).

## The Winning Mix

The most effective strategy is not "one or the other", but how they complement each other.

> A fixed OOH campaign can generate the **frequency** needed to be remembered, while DOOH provides the **novelty** and detailed information at strategic points.
