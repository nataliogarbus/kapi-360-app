# TV Did Not Die: Why Digital Brands Are Returning to Mass Media

**It seems counterintuitive. In a world obsessed with "Click-Through Rate" and direct attribution, why are tech unicorns like MercadoLibre, PedidosYa, or Kavak investing millions in "old reliable" Television? The answer is simple: Trust and Scale.**

For years, digital marketing gurus preached the end of traditional media. But the data tells another story. The fragmentation of digital audiences and the increase in acquisition costs (CAC) have made broadcast and cable television a viable, and even necessary, option for scaling once again.

## 1. The "Trust Halo" Effect

If it's on TV, it's true. Or at least, that is the consumer's subconscious perception. Being on a leading channel's Prime Time grants **instant validation** that an Instagram ad simply cannot replicate.

For a digital brand, appearing on TV is saying: "We are a solid, real company and we are here to stay." This effect reduces friction in online purchasing, indirectly lowering your digital acquisition costs.

## 2. Instant Massive Scale

Digital is excellent for targeting, but TV is unbeatable for **penetration**. If you need 2 million people to know about your new product before the weekend, there is no algorithm that beats a commercial during halftime of a National Team match or the final of a reality show.

## 3. TV Triggers Digital (Second Screen)

User behavior is no longer linear. We watch television with our phones in hand. A well-executed spot generates an immediate wave of Google searches and direct traffic to your app.

Smart brands don't see TV as a rival to digital, but as its **fuel**.

## 4. Real Cost Per Contact

Although the entry ticket is high, the CPM (Cost Per Thousand impressions) of broadcast TV is often more competitive than that of many saturated digital platforms, especially if your product is mass consumption.
