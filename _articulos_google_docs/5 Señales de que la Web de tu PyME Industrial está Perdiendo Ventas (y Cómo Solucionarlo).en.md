## Your Silent Digital Salesperson... or Absent?

For an industrial SME, the website has ceased to be a simple digital brochure. Today, it is your **main sales channel**, your 24/7 showroom, and the first impression a high-value potential client will have of your business. But what happens when this silent salesperson isn't doing their job? Worse yet, what happens if, instead of attracting, it is actively driving away opportunities?

Many business owners underestimate the impact of a poor digital platform. The reality is that a bad web experience is not neutral; it is negative. Below, we present 5 unmistakable signs that your website is losing sales.

### 1. The Coffee Test: Your Web Takes More Than 3 Seconds to Load
Imagine a procurement manager clicks on your site. If they have time to go get a coffee while it loads, **you've already lost them**. In the B2B world, efficiency is synonymous with professionalism. A slow website not only frustrates the user but sends a message to Google: "this site does not offer a good experience." As a result, Google penalizes you, showing you below your competitors.

### 2. The Thumb Verdict: Unusable on Mobile
Managers and purchasing decision-makers are no longer tied to their desks. They research suppliers while traveling or from a plant floor. If navigating your website from a phone requires zooming in or buttons are tiny, the perception is immediate: **"this company is outdated."** A poor mobile experience is a barrier that destroys credibility in seconds.

### 3. The Black Hole: You Have No Idea How Many Opportunities It Generates
If I ask you: "how many qualified prospects did your website generate last quarter?", and your answer is silence, you have a strategic problem. Operating a website without a clear measurement system (analytics, conversion tracking) is like **running your factory blindfolded**. You cannot make decisions if you don't know what works and what your digital return on investment is.

### 4. The Digital Cobweb: Your Latest News is Two Years Old
A client exploring your website looks for signs of trust. If your "News" section hasn't been updated in years, the message is clear: **"this business is stagnant or abandoned."** An outdated website not only damages your Google ranking but generates deep mistrust in the prospect.

### 5. The Final Maze: Contacting You is Mission Impossible
You managed to get a potential client interested, but your contact form is long, confusing, or doesn't work well on mobile. Every extra field, every unnecessary click, is an invitation to abandon. A poor contact process is the equivalent of **having a client at your office door and not letting them in.**
