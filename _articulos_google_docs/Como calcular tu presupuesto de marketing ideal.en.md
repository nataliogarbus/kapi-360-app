## The Most Expensive (and Common) Mistake in Digital Marketing

Most SME directors and marketing managers make the same mistake when defining their advertising investment: **they start with their pockets, not their goals.**

The dialogue usually goes like this:
> *"How much should we invest this month?"*
> *"I don't know, let's try $500 and see what happens."*

This is **playing the lottery**. If you invest **$500**, you will get results worth **$500**. But is that what your business needs to grow? Probably not.

## Reverse Engineering: Your New Best Friend

Instead of asking *"How much do I have left to spend?"*, the right question is: ***"How much do I want to sell?"***.

From that figure, we use **reverse engineering** to calculate the necessary budget. The logic is pure math, not magic:

1.  **Revenue Goal**: Let's say you want to sell **$50,000**.
2.  **Average Ticket**: Your product is worth **$500**. You need **100 Sales**.
3.  **Close Rate**: For every 10 leads, you close 1 (10%). You need **1,000 Leads**.
4.  **Conversion Rate**: For every 100 visits to your site, 2 leave their data (2%). You need **50,000 Visits**.
5.  **Cost Per Click (CPC)**: In your industry, a click costs **$0.50**.
6.  **Required Budget**: 50,000 visits * $0.50 = **$25,000**.

If your goal is to sell $50k, **you need to invest $25k**. If you only invest the initial $500, you will fall short by a long shot, and then blame the agency or the channel ("Facebook doesn't work").

## Kapi's New Tool: Investment Mode

We know doing these calculations by hand is tedious. That's why we've updated our **ROI Calculator** with a new **"Investment Mode"**.

Now you can simply:
1.  Enter your **Monthly Goal**.
2.  Enter your **Ticket**.
3.  Select your **Industry** (we provide the CPC and Conversion benchmarks).

The tool will do all the reverse math for you and tell you exactly how much you should be investing to reach that goal realistically.
