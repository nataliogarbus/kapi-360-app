## The Trap of Infinite ROAS

It's the end of the month. You get the report from your agency or marketing team. It's all green charts and upward arrows.
*"Look! We had a ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) of 10x. For every dollar we put into Google, we sold 10."*

It sounds amazing. You should be swimming in money. But you look at your bank account and... you barely cover costs. **What happened?**

What happened is that **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)** is a vanity metric if looked at alone. It only tells you how effective the ads were at generating gross revenue, but **it completely ignores your real costs.**

## The Difference That Saves Businesses

*   **ROAS**: (Revenue / Ad Cost). Only looks at ads.
*   **ROI (Return on Investment)**: (Net Profit / Total Investment). Looks at the business.

Imagine this scenario:
*   You sell shoes at **$100**.
*   Product cost + shipping + operations = **$70**. (Real margin $30).
*   You invest **$20** in advertising to sell one.

**ROAS**: $100 / $20 = **5x** (Looks great!).
**ROI**: ($100 - $70 - $20) / $20 = **$10 profit**. Or a 50% ROI.

Now, suppose your agency charges a monthly fee. Or you have high fixed costs. That 50% ROI can quickly turn negative, even if the ROAS remains a "successful" 5x.

## Radical Transparency: Calculate Your Real ROI

At Kapi, we believe in **Radical Transparency**. We are not interested in showing you vanity metrics to make you feel good for a while. We are interested in your business being profitable.

That's why we have created a **Free ROI Calculator** that allows you to play with these variables.
We not only calculate traffic, but we include:
*   **Real Close Rates**: Because a lead is not a sale.
*   **Conservative Scenarios**: We allow you to calculate with "low" or "average" rates for your industry, not just the ideal scenario.
