## The Power of a Strategic Start
You have made one of the most important decisions for the growth of your business: partnering with an agency to professionalize your digital presence. The success of this new stage does not begin when the first campaign is launched, but at the first meeting: the **strategic kickoff**.

Arriving at this session with the right information is not just a formality; it is the key for your agency to dive into your business quickly, align the strategy with your real objectives, and start generating results as soon as possible.

This checklist is designed to guide you, whether you are a new Kapi partner or preparing to take the leap.

### 1. Strategic Information: Your Business "North Star"
Before talking about tactics (SEO, social media, etc.), we need to understand the strategy.

*   [ ] **Business Objectives (Beyond Marketing):** What do you want to achieve as a company in the next 6-12 months? (Ex: "Increase revenue by 20%", "Expand to a new province", "Launch a new product line").
*   [ ] **Your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):** Who do you sell to? Describe your perfect client, their "pains", their needs, and how they make purchasing decisions.
*   [ ] **Your Unique Value Proposition (UVP):** In one sentence, why should a customer choose you and not your competition?
*   [ ] **Key Competitors:** Identify 2 or 3 direct competitors. What do you admire about them? Where do you think you have an advantage?

### 2. Digital Assets: The "Keys" to Your Ecosystem
To be able to audit and work, your agency will need access to your current platforms.

*   [ ] **Website Access:** Access credentials to your website administrator (e.g., WordPress).
*   [ ] **Google Analytics Access:** Access permission to your account to analyze traffic.
*   [ ] **Social Media Profiles Access:** Access credentials to company pages (LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.).
*   [ ] **Ad Account Access:** If you have already invested in advertising, access to your Google Ads or Meta Business accounts.

### 3. Brand Material: The "Raw Material" of Your Identity
To ensure that all communication is consistent and professional, your agency will need your brand elements.

*   [ ] **Brand Manual (if it exists):** Document defining colors, fonts, and logo usage.
*   [ ] **Logos:** Your logo in high quality and in different formats (e.g., PNG with transparent background).
*   [ ] **Photo and Video Material:** Access to a folder with photos of your products, your plant, or your team.
*   [ ] **Success Stories or Testimonials:** Any material that demonstrates the satisfaction of your current clients is pure gold.

## Conclusion: Prepared for Growth
Gathering this information before the kickoff forces you to reflect on your own business and positions you as a proactive partner.
