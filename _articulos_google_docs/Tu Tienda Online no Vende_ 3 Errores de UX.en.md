It is the saddest and most common story in ecommerce: you invest thousands in advertising (Ads), drive hundreds of people to your site... and **nobody buys**.

The average conversion rate in e-commerce hovers around 1-2%. If you are below that, you don't have a traffic problem, you have a **friction** problem.

Your website is putting obstacles between your customer's wallet and your bank account. Here are the 3 most common conversion killers we see at **Kapi**:

## 1. The Infinite Checkout

If you ask the user for their ID, birth date, dog's name, and blood type before letting them pay, you lost them.

**The Rule:** Ask only for what is strictly necessary.
*   Enable **Guest Checkout** (without creating an account).
*   Use Google address autocomplete.
*   Show shipping costs *before* the last step. The surprise of expensive shipping at the end is the #1 cause of abandoned carts.

## 2. "Turtle" Loading Speed

Amazon discovered that for every 100ms (milliseconds) of delay, they lost 1% of sales.

If your store takes more than 3 seconds to load, 53% of mobile users leave. And they go to the competition.

**Solution:**
*   Optimize your images (no 5MB photos).
*   Check your hosting.
*   Minimize unnecessary external scripts.

## 3. Lack of Trust and "Social Proof"

In a physical store, you can touch the product. In digital, you have to **believe**. If your site looks messy, has broken links, or does not show clear guarantees, the user distrusts.

**Indispensable:**
*   Real reviews from other buyers (with photos).
*   Clear and visible return policies.
*   Security seals on payment.

Fixing these **UX (User Experience)** errors usually has a much higher return on investment (ROI) than simply increasing the advertising budget.
